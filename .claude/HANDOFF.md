# Handoff — branch clean-up, full audit, documentation refresh

**Updated:** 2026-09-07 (session in progress — this file is kept current as work
proceeds, so the session can be picked up at any point).
**Working branch:** `claude/alpha-wip` — the single work-in-progress branch.
**Target:** one pull request into `alpha` at the end. No stacked pull requests.

---

## Read this first — where we are right now

**Updated 10 September 2026.** Working branch `claude/alpha-wip`, cut from the
updated `alpha`. **Nothing is open against `alpha`** — pull request #473 merged
and deployed earlier today.

### This session, part two: the work queue

Fifteen items were agreed and added to the queue. **Every one now has a GitHub
issue.** The index is `.claude/plans/work-queue.md`; the issues carry the detail.

| Item | Issue |
| --- | --- |
| Drop end-of-life MySQL 8.0; target MySQL 9.7 / MariaDB 12.3 / PHP 8.5 | **#475** ⛔ blocked |
| Repair version + changelog automation on `alpha` | **#476** |
| "Check my portal" page for administrators | **#477** |
| Make switching an app off actually switch it off | **#478** |
| Prove the "delete my data" list is complete | **#479** |
| Decide the minimum password length | **#480** ⛔ needs a decision |
| Stop three migrations switching apps back on | **#481** |
| Document the other 29 data endpoints | **#482** |
| Finish the mobile pass on a real phone | #225 (existing) |
| Small clean-ups worth doing together | **#483** |
| Warn when a deploy is about to remove files | #107 (existing) |
| Keep a history of settings changes | **#484** |
| In-app messaging | #304 (existing) |
| Update the self-hosted Swagger UI | **#486** |
| Re-verify the database structure before the first customer | **#487** |
| *(added)* Translation is a shell | **#485** |

### ⛔ Two things are blocked on the owner

**1. Which MySQL 8 the live site is running** — this decides most of #475.

DreamHost's published documentation says shared hosting runs **MySQL version 8**,
offers no MariaDB, and does **not** let a customer choose the version — a newer
one needs a Dedicated or DreamCompute plan. (An earlier draft of this note
guessed MariaDB. That was wrong, and it was corrected after a review.)

So "target MySQL 9.7" cannot mean what customers on shared hosting will run. It
can only mean what the code supports. Still worth having, but forward planning
rather than a fix.

**The question that matters is which MySQL 8.** On **8.4 LTS**, support runs to
2029 and there is no urgent problem. On **8.0**, the product is on a database
that stopped receiving security fixes in April 2026 — an owner decision: stay
put, move hosting tier, or support other hosts.

**Quick to check:** the portal already reads and shows the database version on
the admin dashboard. Look at the live site.

Still true either way: no minimum database version is enforced, the automated
test covers only MySQL 8.0.36, and MariaDB is not covered by any test here.

Also unsettled: how far #475 should go. Raising the minimums and testing against
the new versions is a few days. Adding conditional code so one codebase runs
correctly on old and new versions is considerably more and adds a branch to
maintain forever. Recommendation recorded in #475: do the first stage on its
own, because it is the foundation the second would need anyway.

**2. The minimum password length** — #480. An existing site could still be
enforcing an 8-character minimum while the documentation, the help page and the
code's own fallback all say 12. Raise them automatically, or tell administrators
and let them choose? Recommendation in the issue: tell them. The 8 is almost
certainly the ghost of an old seed rather than anybody's decision, but that
cannot be shown for any particular site.

### 🔴 The finding worth reading before anything else

**#485 — automatic translation of user-written content has no way in.** An
administrator can pick a paid provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, DeepL), enter
an API key and set a spending cap. A member can go to their account page and opt
in. **Neither does anything**, because nothing a user can reach ever calls the
translation code.

Be precise about two things here, because loose wording caused a false claim in
the first draft of this note. The only caller of `Translation::translate()` is
`web/_apps/api/translate.php` — so it is not true that there is "no caller
anywhere". That file simply cannot be reached: addresses starting `api/` go to
ApiRouter, which needs `api/{app}/{action}` and looks elsewhere. And this is
**separate from interface translation** (`I18n` and the `t()` function), which
works normally — the portal does translate its own screens.

Two reasons it is urgent rather than merely wrong. It goes to a first customer
soon, and somebody could enter a billable credential for something that will
never make a request. And it must be settled **before** #483, because that
clean-up deletes the unreachable file that is the only surviving description of
how it was meant to work.

Note migration 158 removed that file's routing-table row, but the address was
**already** unreachable — `api/` paths never consult the routing table. So 158
tidied a dead row; it did not break a working feature.

Issue #278 was closed as delivering this. It has been commented, not reopened.

**This is the fourth time this pattern has appeared** — #322 web push, #273
livestream, #278 translation, and six unreachable help guides. Built, reviewed,
merged, closed; nobody could reach it. Recorded in memory as
`webms-shipped-but-unreachable`. It is the strongest argument for #477.

### Suggested order when work resumes

1. **#476** — about an hour, and stops `alpha` reporting the wrong version.
2. **#485** — decide before #483 destroys the evidence.
3. **#477** — widest reach; would have caught most of this audit.
4. **#481, #483** — small and mechanical.
5. **#475** once the hosting question is answered, then **#487** after it.

## 1. The branch clean-up (done)

Six branches were sitting on GitHub with no pull request attached.

**`claude/venue-b` … `claude/venue-f`** were five workers building one job — the
Venues app — side by side from a shared starting point. Their output was
gathered into `claude/venue-bookings` and merged into `alpha` as pull request
**#431** on 28 August. Checked file by file, every one of them was either
already identical to `alpha` or an older version `alpha` has since improved. A
trial merge of each produced conflicts that would have **undone** later work —
most importantly the room-aware booking coverage added for issue #436 in pull
request #452. **Nothing was outstanding; merging would have caused a
regression.** All five deleted.

**`claude/dependabot-alpha-beta-branches-q24zd7`** had a misleading name — no
dependency updates and no program code, only twelve planning documents that
existed nowhere else, covering work that has since shipped in nine pull
requests (434, 441, 444, 445, 446, 451, 452, 454 and 455) and including two
security reviews. Those twelve documents were copied onto `claude/alpha-wip` under
`.claude/plans/gap-items/`. The branch was then deleted.

The full method and evidence is in `.claude/plans/branch-audit-2026-09-07.md`.
**The lesson worth keeping: never judge a branch by its commit messages.**

## 2. Swagger UI + the /api-docs page (done — commit `8f21094`)

Three problems, all fixed:

1. **The page broke without internet access.** Swagger UI was only ever fetched
   from a public content delivery network, with no local copy to fall back on —
   unlike Bootstrap and Font Awesome, which have always had one. On a network
   that blocks public CDNs the page was a blank white screen. The three files
   are now committed under `public_html/assets/vendor/swagger-ui/` and wired
   into the existing fallback machinery. Each was verified to hash to the SRI
   value `Asset.php` already recorded, so the local copy is provably identical
   to what the CDN serves.
2. **"Try it out" could never write anything.** The page read the anti-forgery
   token from a `<meta name="csrf-token">` tag, but the page deliberately
   bypasses the shared template that emits that tag — so the token was always
   empty and every write was refused with "CSRF check failed". The page now
   emits its own. And because the portal replaces the token every time it
   accepts one, `ApiAuth::requireWrite()` now hands the replacement back as
   `meta.csrfToken` so a second write does not fail.
3. **The page phoned home** to `validator.swagger.io`. Switched off.

New setting `api.docs.local_assets_only` (migration 185, seeded off) skips the
CDN entirely for sites whose network blocks it.

## 3. PHP on the development machine (done)

There was no PHP installed, so Visual Studio Code could not check files and the
build's hard lint gate could not be reproduced locally. Installed **PHP 8.5.10**
via Homebrew (the project's exact target version), pointed the editor at it via
`.vscode/settings.json` (which git ignores, so it stays on this machine), and
confirmed all 785 PHP files pass `php -l`.

`DEV_NOTES.md` now has **"Installing PHP on your own machine"** with
step-by-step instructions for macOS, Windows, Linux and Raspberry Pi.

## 4. What the audit found, and what has been done about it

Audit reports so far, in the session scratchpad under `analysis/`:
`01-inventory.md` (apps, routes, handlers) and `02-core-schema.md` (core
classes, migrations, tables, CI). Every finding below was independently
re-verified before being acted on.

### ✅ Already fixed — commit `6c01c47` (migration 186)

- **The notification preferences page could not be opened.** Two pages were
  both called "Notification preferences"; migration 093 gave the address to
  the newsletter-only one, hiding the real page. Browser push opt-in was
  therefore only reachable from the livestream page. The newsletter checkbox
  is now a card on the real page, the newsletter-only page is deleted, and
  the address points back where it belongs.
- **The livestream channels and schedule page could not be opened** — with it
  went the only button that tells subscribers "we are live now". It now has
  its own address, `/admin/livestream/channels`, linked from the analytics
  page.
- **Six help guides nobody could find** — Venue Bookings, Forms Builder,
  Reports, Admin First Steps, Disaster Recovery and Getting Support existed
  with working addresses but no link anywhere. All 18 guides are now on the
  Help Centre index.
- Removed four settings that switched on API endpoints whose handler files do
  not exist.

### ✅ Already fixed — commit `82241bc`

- **Six menu and dashboard links led to "page not found"** (`/expenses`,
  `/kids`, `/reports`, `/salvation`, `/worship`, `/webhooks`). New
  `Router::routeExists()` means those generated links are left out when a
  successful lookup finds no registered address for them, and a new optional `landing` field on an app's registry entry
  says where to link when the app's own prefix is not a page. The `route`
  field could not simply be corrected — it is the prefix used to decide which
  app owns a page for the on/off switch.
- **An app switched on at `/admin/apps` never appeared in the menu.** That
  screen writes `'1'`; the menu insisted on `'true'`. Both now accepted.
- **"Run all pending migrations" would have put demo data into a live site.**
  `Migrator::allFiles()` accepted any `.sql` file, so `full_schema.sql` and
  `demo_data.sql` always showed as pending. Both `allFiles()` and `runOne()`
  now accept only numbered files.
- **Four of the eleven safety checks were never run by any workflow.** All
  four now run on every pull request.

### ⚠️ SUPERSEDED — this section described problems that are now FIXED

**Everything that used to be listed here has shipped**, in pull request #473
(merged 10 September 2026). The section has been removed rather than left in
place, because it did more than go stale: it recommended an approach that was
later tried and **proved wrong**.

For the record, so nobody repeats it:

- It proposed de-duplicating the settings table by **keeping the newest row**.
  That would have deleted saved payment credentials. Several screens find their
  row with an unordered `SELECT … LIMIT 1` and update that one, which in
  practice is the OLDEST copy. The rule that shipped prefers the row that looks
  edited, then the most recently written, then the newest.
- It proposed a **STORED** derived column. MySQL refuses a cascading foreign key
  on the base column of a STORED derived column, and `tblSettings.siteID` has
  one, so `full_schema.sql` would not load at all. The column that shipped is
  **VIRTUAL**.
- It proposed `COALESCE(siteID, 0)`. The value that shipped is **-1**, because a
  site numbered 0 is not impossible on an imported database, and 0 would then be
  confused with "applies to every site".

Both mistakes were caught by the Codex review, not by any automated check —
every one of those checks passed on the wrong version. That is the argument for
the review rule in `.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

What actually shipped is described in the changelog, in migration 187, and in
`DEV_NOTES.md` under "The settings table". Issues #466, #467, #468, #469, #470
and #471 are all closed with evidence.

## 5. Verified-clean baseline

Measured on this branch, so a later regression is obvious:

- **785** PHP files, all pass `php -l` (the exact command CI uses).
- **All 11** checks in `tools/audit-checks/` pass.
- **559** live routes, **0** pointing at a missing file.
- **566** settings keys seeded, **0** read without being seeded and without a
  fallback.
- **184** numbered migrations (000-184; 168 and 169 were never used), all
  re-runnable, **no** MariaDB-only syntax.
- **209** database tables, **0** column-name mismatches.
- **54** app directories, **47** in the installable-app registry, **19** help
  pages, **62** API handlers, **63** documented API operations.

## 6. How this session is being run

- **Deep analysis and planning:** sequential Fable 5 agents, never parallel.
  Fall back to Opus only if Fable is unavailable, and retry Fable next time.
- **Building:** Sonnet or Haiku; Opus only when genuinely hard.
- **Everything written in plain English** — replies, comments, commits, pull
  requests, issues, documentation, in-app help. Now a standing rule in
  `.claude/CLAUDE.md`.
- **After each piece of work:** commit and push, update the GitHub issue, update
  `.claude/`, update this file.
- **One pull request only**, at the end, into `alpha`.

## 7. If you are picking this up cold

1. `git checkout claude/alpha-wip && git pull`
2. Read `.claude/plans/branch-audit-2026-09-07.md` for why the branches went.
3. Read the audit reports in the session scratchpad under `analysis/` —
   `01-inventory.md` is the ground truth for apps, routes and handlers.
4. The findings in section 4 above are the work queue. None is fixed yet.
5. `php -l` and `python3 tools/audit-checks/*.py` are the local gates. Both were
   clean at the last commit.
