 * Events — calendar/RSVP domain logic 📅 (#334 v1.1 follow-up)
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * New core class for calendar/event business logic that doesn't belong
 * inline in an app controller. First (and currently only) resident:
 * `promoteFromWaitlist()` — the waitlist auto-promotion #334's own rsvp.php
 * doc comment reserved as a v1.1 follow-up ("Chronological promotion
 * happens in v1.1 — settings hook + cron will sweep waitlistedAt order").
 * This ships the promotion itself as an event-driven call (no cron needed):
 * every place `web/_apps/calendar/rsvp.php` frees a confirmed seat calls
 * `Events::promoteFromWaitlist()` immediately afterwards.

    /**
     * Promote as many earliest-waitlisted RSVPs as now fit into an event's
     * freed-up capacity. Call this immediately after ANY write that could
     * free a confirmed seat — a confirmed RSVP switching to 'not_going',
     * a confirmed row being cancelled/deleted, or a confirmed guestCount
     * being reduced.
     *
     * TRANSACTIONAL: the event row, the confirmed-seats aggregate, and the
     * waitlist candidate rows are all read with `FOR UPDATE` inside one
     * `App::beginTransaction()`/`commit()`/`rollback()` unit, so two
     * concurrent slot-freeing writes for the SAME event can never both
     * compute the same "remaining capacity" and double-promote past it.
     *
     * Candidates are tried earliest-waitlisted-first (`waitlistedAt ASC,
     * createdAt ASC`); a party whose `1 + guestCount` doesn't fit the seats
     * currently remaining is skipped (left on the waitlist) rather than
     * halting the sweep — a smaller party further down the list may still
     * fit the same freed-up capacity.
     *
     * Confirmation emails are sent AFTER the transaction commits (same
     * Mailer pattern as `event-register-save.php`'s own confirmation
     * email) — a mail failure is caught + logged per-recipient and can
     * NEVER roll back a promotion that has already committed.
     *
     * NEVER throws — any failure (bad connection, a mid-transaction
     * exception) is caught, logged via `error_log()`, the transaction
     * rolled back, and 0 returned.
     *
     * @param int $eventId
     *
     * @return int Number of RSVPs promoted from 'waitlist' to 'confirmed'.
